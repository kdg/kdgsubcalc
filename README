How to compile
--------------

Windows users should install MinGW first, and add the bin folder to the PATH, so that your computer knows where to find GCC.
Then you should just double click the compile_gcc_win.bat file, and a binary should appear

Linux/OS X users should execute the following command in the main source tree:
gcc -o kdgsubcalc src/kdgsubcalc.c

This will produce an executable in the current directory called kdgsubcalc.
